# Cinnog example

**This [Cinnog] App is deployed on Netlify: https://cinnog.netlify.app/**

Cinnog is a static site generator using [Leptos] with Bevy ECS as a data layer. It currently depends on the `m̀ain` branch of Leptos to be able to directly serve the output directory as a static website and better integrate the data layer.

- `cargo make serve` serves the App with watch mode and hot-reload enabled.
- `cargo make build` builds the project in release. The output will be in the `dist` directory and the command will not serve it, but quit instead.
- `cargo make fmt` formats with `rustfmt` and `leptosfmt`.
- `cargo make e2e` runs the end-to-end tests from the `end2end` directory using [Playwright].

Cinnog is not yet published and this repository depends on the latest commit.

## The Data layer

[Bevy ECS] is used in an attempt to add a data layer to Leptos as a static site generator. The idea is similar to what Gatsby does with GraphQL using a Bevy ECS World as an in-memory database. The API of Bevy ECS is very nice to work with as a user. It removes any need of an extra syntax for data queries.

[Cinnog] is quite minimal at the moment and very experimental. In `generator`, a new data layer is constructed and filled with example data from markdown and `ron` files.

When all data is loaded and processed, Cinnog can build a given Leptos app and will supply the data layer in a context. Inside components, you can run [Systems][bevy_systems] against the data layer (think GraphQL query in Gatsby) and use [Resources][bevy_resources].
